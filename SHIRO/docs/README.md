## SHIRO Documentation

---

This directory contains the documentation for SHIRO. (yep)

To know about this project's structure, please refer to the [repo.md](repo.md) file.

For style guidelines, please refer to the [style.md](style.md) file.

Each file and directory in this directory is a part of the documentation, and it should be self-explanatory enough, so
you probably don't need this readme.md
